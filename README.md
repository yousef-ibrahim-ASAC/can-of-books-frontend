## Cooperative

### Make a list of each parson’s strengths

* yousef : like to work in back-end.
* ibrahim : like to work in front-end.

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

* We will use our experience to enhance our application to be in the best workability.

### In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

* yousef : to enhance his functionality in front-end.
* ibrahim : to enhance his functionality in back-end.

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

* at the end of every day, we will explain to each other what everyone worked on.

## Conflict Resolution

### What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

* We will divide the work to each person, and every day we will make sure of the work that everyone has done.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

* At first, I will try to reach an understanding with him. If he is not convinced, I will tell one of the officials.

### How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Every day each person will work in a new particular part, and there will be no conflict.
